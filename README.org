* Nearweb

  This is an extremely simple webapp which will give you a list of
  websites of places near your physical location. It uses [[http://simplegeo.com][SimpleGeo]]â€™s
  [[http://simplegeo.com/producs/places/][Places product]] to locate points of interest near you, then displays
  the ones which have an associated website.
